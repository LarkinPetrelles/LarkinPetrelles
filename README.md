**CompTIA Security+ Certified | AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) | AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) Candidate**

I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer specializing in implementing secure, scalable, and cost-optimized infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). My expertise combines foundational security principles with practical cloud architecture and FinOps, ensuring solutions are robust, compliant, and efficient.

## AWS Cloud Security & Infrastructure Portfolio

The following projects demonstrate hands-on experience in provisioning, securing, and managing core AWS services, supplemented by cloud governance experience.

### 1. AWS EC2 Security Hardening & Network Segmentation
**Objective:** Deploy, configure, and secure Linux instances within AWS while demonstrating network control and resource lifecycle management.

**Summary:** This project involved provisioning and managing cloud-based servers using **AWS EC2** Linux instances, ensuring secure SSH access and managing the instance lifecycle, including termination. A core focus was on networking fundamentals, requiring performance of **CIDR/Subnetting** calculations (e.g., /20, /16 blocks) to understand **VPC segmentation** and proper resource isolation within the AWS environment. The work confirmed an understanding of secure resource management and foundational **hypervisor security** concepts for virtualization.

### 2. Multi-Cloud Governance & Financial Operations (FinOps)
*Showcases vendor-agnostic architectural design, compliance, and cost control competency.*

**Objective:** Design a comprehensive cloud adoption strategy and conduct a financial analysis to ensure cost-effective, compliant deployment.

**Summary:** I developed a detailed **Cloud Cost Model** (Pay-as-you-go vs. Reserved) demonstrating financial proficiency and **optimizing cloud spending**, reducing potential annual costs by over $270K for a large-scale deployment. Further work included designing a governance structure utilizing hierarchical resource management (**Azure Management Groups/Resource Groups**) to ensure adherence to high-level compliance standards (e.g., **FedRAMP**). The project also required documentation and analysis of advanced networking concepts like **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** and **Intent-Based Networking (IBN)**, which are critical for modern cloud automation and security control planes.

### 3. AWS Ubuntu Server Deployment & Log Analysis (Threat Detection Foundation)
**Objective:** Deploy a secure Ubuntu Server in AWS and simulate an internal threat detection workflow.

**Summary:** This hands-on lab focused on provisioning an **AWS EC2** Ubuntu instance, configuring basic security rules, and then simulating common reconnaissance. The critical step involved parsing Apache logs to detect and analyze suspicious scan activity, demonstrating a foundational understanding of threat logging and detection workflows.

## Next Steps: Mastering AWS Security Automation

- Transition from manual deployments to automated infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform** or **CloudFormation** (AWS Infrastructure as Code).
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring for threat detection using AWS services like **CloudWatch**, **GuardDuty**, and **Security Hub**.
- Build an automated, secure CI/CD pipeline leveraging **AWS CodeCommit/CodePipeline** with security scanning integration.

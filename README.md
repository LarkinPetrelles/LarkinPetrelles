I am a current student working towards completing my bachelors degree in Fall 2025 majoring in CyberSecurity Technology. I have a profound interest in technology, a dedication to solving complex problems, and curiousity to learn more about these systems to ensure our security throughout our ever changing world.

## **Objective**

My journey has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I am eager to transition into this field fully from the finance field. As I'm looking to transition, I am eager to start in any IT role to begin my career and gain foundational experience. Whether it is in security or another aspect of IT.

## **Skills Highlight**

- **Cloud & Virtualization**:  
  - Provisioned and managed cloud-based servers using AWS EC2.  
  - Deployed and configured Ubuntu Server instances in AWS.  
  - Managed multiple virtual machines using Oracle VM VirtualBox.  

- **System Administration**:  
  - Performed Linux server updates, upgrades, and log analysis.  
  - Configured security rules, firewalls, and access controls.  
  - Managed user accounts and group policies via Active Directory.  

- **Networking**:  
  - Configured VLANs and static IPs for secure communication.  
  - Performed network diagnostics and connectivity verification.  

- **Penetration Testing & Security Analysis**:  
  - Conducted reconnaissance using Nmap and Zenmap.  
  - Performed vulnerability scans with OpenVAS.  
  - Exploited insecure services (e.g., Telnet) to simulate breaches.  
  - Documented findings and remediation strategies in professional reports.

## **Projects**

### **1. AWS Ubuntu Server Deployment & Log Analysis**
- **Objective**: Deploy and manage a secure Ubuntu Server in AWS while simulating an internal threat detection workflow.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Provisioned an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance.  
  2. Configured SSH access from a local host system.  
  3. Performed system updates (`apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade`).  
  4. Conducted Nmap and Nikto scans against an Apache web server.  
  5. Parsed Apache logs to detect suspicious scan activity.

### **2. Domain Controller & Active Directory Setup**
- **Objective**: Centralize authentication and manage resources in a Windows Server environment.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Installed Active Directory Domain Services.  
  2. Linked client machines to the domain.  
  3. Managed users, permissions, and policies.  

---

### **3. Red Team Penetration Testing**
- **Objective**: Simulate a real-world penetration test against a vulnerable Linux target.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Conducted reconnaissance and scanning with Zenmap/OpenVAS.  
  2. Exploited Telnet to gain shell access.  
  3. Located and exfiltrated sensitive files.  
  4. Produced detailed penetration test documentation.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Cloud & Virtualization**: AWS EC2, Oracle VM VirtualBox  
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu Server (Linux), Windows OS, Windows Server  
- **Directory & Networking**: Active Directory Domain Services, VLAN Configuration, Static IP Management  
- **Security & Administration**: Windows Firewall (Server Manager), Linux Firewall (UFW), Access Controls  
- **Penetration Testing Tools**: Kali Linux, Zenmap/Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit Framework  
- **Scripting & Utilities**: Bash, Netcat, Telnet, SSH  

---

## **Next Steps**
- Automate cloud and VM provisioning/configuration with Ansible or Terraform.  
- Implement intrusion detection and monitoring with Snort, Wazuh, or ELK Stack.  
- Expand homelab with hybrid Windows/Linux environments for cross-platform security management.  
- Simulate advanced attack chains using custom payloads and C2 frameworks (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Sliver).  
- Develop automated red team reporting workflows and integrate vulnerability remediation tracking.

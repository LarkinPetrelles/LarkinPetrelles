Transitioning from an industry I spent five years in sounds like it may be hard (which it was), but the mortgage business has prepared me for anything. I first started as a Loan Partner after moving back home during COVID when I was 22. It gave me the opportunity to work with thousands of people buying their first (or fifth) home. There were many trials and earning my clients trust with their financing was nerve-wracking at first. However, it was where I genuinely came into my own as a professional and gave me the confidence I needed to succeed in anything I set my sights on. This experience ultimately sparked my transition to Cloud and IT. The cloud is the foundation of our evolving world but also a complex system that needs protection. I realized I wanted to build a challenging career in my own way, dedicated to mastering these systems and making this path my own. That background in finance directly fostered the relentless attention to detail, ability to succeed under pressure, and strong client-facing skills that are essential to being an effective Cloud Engineer.

## AWS Cloud Security & Infrastructure Portfolio

Projects demonstrating core competency in AWS services, security controls, and cloud governance.

### 1. AWS EC2 Security Hardening & Network Segmentation
**Objective:** Deploy and secure Linux instances within AWS while enforcing network control.

**Summary:** Secured and managed AWS EC2 Linux instances. Designed VPC segmentation and ensured resource isolation by performing CIDR/Subnetting calculations. Confirmed competence in secure resource management and hypervisor security principles.

### 2. Multi-Cloud Governance & Financial Operations (FinOps)
*Demonstrates architectural design, compliance, and cost control.*

**Objective:** Design a cloud adoption strategy and conduct financial analysis for cost-effective, compliant deployment.

**Summary:** Performed FinOps cost optimization, modeling two pricing structures and providing a recommendation that reduced potential annual expenses by over **$270K**. Designed a governance structure (Azure Management Groups/Resource Groups) to enforce policy and ensure compliance standards (e.g., FedRAMP). Documented advanced networking concepts: SDN and IBN.

### 3. AWS Ubuntu Server Deployment & Log Analysis
**Objective:** Deploy a secure Ubuntu Server in AWS and simulate a threat detection workflow.

**Summary:** Provisioned an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance and configured security rules. Key deliverable was parsing Apache logs to detect and analyze suspicious scan activity, confirming foundational threat logging and detection skills.

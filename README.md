## AWS Cloud Security & Infrastructure Portfolio

Projects demonstrating experience provisioning, securing, and managing core AWS services, complemented by cloud governance expertise.

### 1. AWS EC2 Security Hardening & Network Segmentation
**Objective:** Deploy, configure, and secure Linux instances within AWS while enforcing network control and managing the resource lifecycle.

**Summary:** Successfully provisioned and managed cloud servers using AWS EC2 Linux instances, including configuration for secure SSH access and complete instance lifecycle management. Applied foundational networking expertise by performing CIDR/Subnetting calculations (e.g., /20, /16 blocks) to design VPC segmentation and ensure resource isolation. This project confirmed competence in secure resource management and hypervisor security.

### 2. Multi-Cloud Governance & Financial Operations (FinOps)
*Demonstrates vendor-agnostic architectural design, compliance, and cost control competency.*

**Objective:** Design a comprehensive cloud adoption strategy and conduct a financial analysis to ensure cost-effective, compliant deployment.

**Summary:** I developed a detailed Cloud Cost Model (Pay-as-you-go vs. Reserved) to optimize cloud spending, providing a cost-effective recommendation that reduced potential annual expenses by over **$270K**. This included designing a governance structure utilizing hierarchical resource management (Azure Management Groups/Resource Groups) to enforce policy and ensure compliance standards (e.g., FedRAMP). The work also covered advanced networking concepts like Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Intent-Based Networking (IBN), critical for modern security and automation.

### 3. AWS Ubuntu Server Deployment & Log Analysis (Threat Detection Foundation)
**Objective:** Deploy a secure Ubuntu Server in AWS and simulate an internal threat detection workflow.

**Summary:** This lab involved provisioning an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance, configuring basic security rules, and simulating reconnaissance. The key deliverable was parsing Apache logs to detect and analyze suspicious scan activity, confirming a foundational understanding of threat logging and detection workflows.

## Next Steps: Mastering AWS Security Automation

- Transition from manual deployments to automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform or CloudFormation (IaC).
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring for threat detection using AWS services like CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.
- Build an automated, secure CI/CD pipeline leveraging AWS CodeCommit/CodePipeline with security scanning integration.

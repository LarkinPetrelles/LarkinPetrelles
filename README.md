I am a current student working towards completing my bachelors degree in Fall 2025 majoring in CyberSecurity Technology. I have a profound interest in technology, a dedication to solving complex problems, and curiousity to learn more about these systems to ensure our security throughout our ever changing world.

## **Objective**

My journey has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field fully from the finance field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a SOC Analyst, become a CyberSecurity Analyst who focuses on monitoring/engineering or become a Windows Systems Administrator.

## **IT & Cybersecurity Homelab Projects**

A collection of projects demonstrating hands-on skills in virtualization, networking, and system administration. These projects highlight practical implementations and foundational knowledge in IT and cybersecurity.

---

## **Skills Highlight**

- **Virtualization**:  
  - Set up and managed virtual machines using Oracle VM VirtualBox.  
  - Installed and configured Windows OS for multiple virtual environments.  

- **Active Directory**:  
  - Configured a Windows-based domain controller and linked another VM via Active Directory.  
  - Managed user accounts, permissions, and group policies.  

- **Networking**:  
  - Created and configured VLANs with static IPs for secure and efficient communication.  
  - Integrated VLAN with a secondary VM to enhance connectivity and security.  

- **System Administration**:  
  - Enforced security rules and configurations on linked VMs.  
  - Managed domain connections and monitored resource access.  
  - Configured a Windows Firewall in the domain controller VM using Server Manager.  
  - Defined and managed blocked and allowed ports to enhance network security.

## **Projects**

### **1. Domain Controller Setup**
- **Objective**: Configure a Windows domain controller to manage network resources.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Created a VM with Windows Server.  
  2. Installed and set up Active Directory Domain Services.  
  3. Linked a second VM to the domain.  

---

### **2. Network Segmentation with VLANs**
- **Objective**: Isolate and secure network traffic between virtual machines.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Configured VLANs with static IPs.  
  2. Integrated VLAN into a secondary VM.  

---

### **3. Active Directory Integration**
- **Objective**: Enforce domain policies across networked machines.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Created and managed user accounts.  
  2. Applied group policies to impose security rules on the second VM.  

---

### **4. Firewall Configuration on Domain Controller and other VMs connected to Domain Controller**
- **Objective**: Enhance network security by configuring a firewall in the domain controller.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Configured Windows Firewall through Server Manager on the domain controller VM.  
  2. Defined inbound and outbound rules for blocked and allowed ports.  
  3. Tested connectivity and verified that access control policies were functioning as intended.  

---

## **Tools & Technologies**
- Oracle VM VirtualBox  
- Windows OS & Windows Server  
- Active Directory Domain Services  
- VLAN Configuration  
- Windows Firewall Configuration (Server Manager)  

---

## **Next Steps**
- Automate VM provisioning and configurations using tools like Ansible.  
- Explore intrusion detection systems (IDS) and monitoring tools like Snort or ELK Stack.  
- Expand homelab to include Linux-based systems for cross-platform management and log review.
